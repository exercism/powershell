# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student about `boolean` values and logical operators in powershell.
It also introduce comment block as `comment based help`.


## Learning objectives

- Create a `bool` object via literal declaration
- Create a `bool` object from using logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Create comment block and write `comment-based help`


## Out of scope

- Obtain `bool` object from:
    - Comparison: `-gt`, `-lt`, `-eq`, `-ne`, etc
    - Membership: `-in`, `-contains`, `-haskey`, etc
    - Identity: `-is`
    - Collection types
- Orders of evaluation

## Concepts

**booleans:**
- Know about `bool` type and its two value: `$true` and `$false`
- Know about logicals operators and use them to build expression
- Know boolean operator precedence

**comment based help**
- Know about comment block
- Know how to write comment-base help using keywords and comment block


## Prerequisites

- `basics`
