.SYNOPSIS
Implement the circular buffer data structure.

.DESCRIPTION
A circular buffer, cyclic buffer or ring buffer is a data structure that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end.
Please implement the circular buffer class with these methods:
- Write     : write new value into the buffer, raise error if the buffer is full.
- Overwrite : overwrite the oldest element in the buffer if the buffer is full, otherwise behave like write.
- Clear     : clear all elements in the buffer, it is now empty.
- Read      : read the oldest element in the buffer, and return its value.

.EXAMPLE
$buffer = [CircularBuffer]::new(2)

$buffer.Write(1)
$buffer.Read()
Return: 1

$buffer.Write(2)
$buffer.Write(3)
$buffer.Overwrite(5)
$buffer.Read()
Return: 5

$buffer.Clear()
$buffer.Read()
Throw "BufferError: Circular buffer is empty"

Class CircularBuffer {
    CircularBuffer() {
        Throw "Please implement this class"
    }

    Write() {
        Throw "Please implement this function"
    }

    Overwrite() {
        Throw "Please implement this function"
    }

    Clear() {
        Throw "Please implement this function"
    }

    Read() {
        Throw "Please implement this function"
    }
}
