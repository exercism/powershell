# CLI (Command Line Interface)

You can run the tests by opening powershell in the exercise's directory, and then running the `Invoke-Pester` command.

Once all the tests are passing, you can submit your solution by using the [`exercism submit` command][docs-exercism-cli].

For further reading there is an introduction to [Powershell][introduction-to-powershell] including on how to write tests yourself.
