# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student some of the basics of programming with Powershell.

## Learning objectives

- Know what a variable is and how to define it in many ways.
- Know how to update or reassign variable.
- Know that variable can have type conversion.
- Know what a `function` is, its basic interface and how to define one via `function`.
- Know how to add one or more `parameters` to a function definition.
- Know that `parameters` definitions can have type annotations.
- Know how to return a value from a function with `return` keyword.
- Know how to call a function with zero or more arguments.
- Know how to declare an integer, float, or string.
- Know how to use mathematical operators `+` and `*` on integers and/or floats.
- Know how to define basic single-line comments.
- Get familiar with some of the basic Cmdlets.

## Out of scope
